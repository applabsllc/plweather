# PL Weather Project

PL Weather Project is a webpage meant for a user to search any city in the world and find accurate weather data and a 7 day forecast.

The project is built purely in HTML, JS, and CSS, using no third-party or external libraries. The project is served using Node. Installation of node can be done here: https://nodejs.org/ 

Demo Here: http://applabsllc.com/plweather/

This project was a code assessment for Animal Farm. The assessment is meant to show skills in HTML/JS/CSS even though position was for React Development (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) .

## Installation

```

The project uses no libraries, so npm install is not necessary.
